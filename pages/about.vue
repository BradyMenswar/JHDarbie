                <p class="text-[16px]">JH Darbie & Co. was founded in 1997 by Robert Rabinowitz. Over the past 20 years Mr. Rabinowitz has completed the acquisition of several competing retail broker/dealers including an online brokerage operation.  After successfully consolidating operations, JH Darbie & Co. has emerged as a broker dealer providing a full range of financial services with its New York City corporate headquarters strategically located on Wall Street.  Over the past few years of financial turmoil JH Darbie remained strong and grew organically with the addition of three US branch office locations.  Currently there are plans for additional expansion. With the synergies from our institutional sales & trading divisions JH Darbie has become an invaluable resource for companies seeking both domestic and international capital.  We proudly continue to successfully complete numerous financing and advisory assignments for public and private companies.</p>
